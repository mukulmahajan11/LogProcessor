# Bigdata_Group5
Beyond the crash, understanding US accident with bigdata

This initiative intends to use big data technologies in the field of urban mobility by examining road accident records all over America to enhance safety and efficiency. As part of our framework for advanced data analytics, we combine various sources such as live traffic patterns, and weather conditions among others which are generated by IoT devices. The project also seeks to establish dangerous areas, optimize traffic flow and predict potential accident points using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark and AWS among other technologies. Our method not only assures better community protection and city planning but also shows how practical big data can be used to create intelligent cities that respond quickly to changes around them. This task is focused on realizing the breadth and speed at which knowledge can be acquired from large datasets while trying out inventive ways within smart city frameworks.
